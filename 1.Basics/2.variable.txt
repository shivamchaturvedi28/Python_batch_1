### Variables
Variables are fundamental elements in programming used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them, and they do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

## Declaring And Assigning Variables



## printing the variables





## Naming Conventions
## Variable names should be descriptive
## They must start with a letter or an '_' and contains letter,numbers and underscores
## variables names case sensitive

#valid variable names





# Invalid variable names




## Understnading Variable types
## Python is dynamically typed,type of a variable is determined at runtime








## Type Checking and Conversion






# Type conversion






## Dynamic Typing
## Python allows the type of a vraible to change as the program executes






## input






### Simple calculator
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

sum = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num1 / num2

print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
