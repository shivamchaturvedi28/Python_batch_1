## DataTypes
#### 1. Definition:

- Data types are a classification of data which tell the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.
- They determine the type of operations that can be performed on the data, the values that the data can take, and the amount of memory needed to store the data.

#### 2. Importance of Data Types in Programming
Explanation:

- Data types ensure that data is stored in an efficient way.
- They help in performing correct operations on data.
- Proper use of data types can prevent errors and bugs in the program.
