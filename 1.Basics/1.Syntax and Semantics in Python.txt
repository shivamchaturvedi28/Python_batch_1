Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in a language. In simpler terms, syntax is about the correct arrangement of words and symbols in a code.

Semantics refers to the meaning or the interpretation of the symbols, characters, and commands in a language. It is about what the code is supposed to do when it runs.



## Basic Syntax Rules In Python
## Case sensitivity- Python is case sensitive



### Indentation
Indentation in Python is used to define the structure and hierarchy of the code. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces {} to delimit blocks of code, Python uses indentation to determine the grouping of statements. This means that all the statements within a block must be indented at the same level.



## Indentation
## Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Consistent use of spaces (commonly 4) or a tab is required.

## Line Continuation
##Use a backslash (\) to continue a statement to the next line
